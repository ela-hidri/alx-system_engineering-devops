Command line for the win

we have done 27 tasks on the CMD CHALLENGE platform in this project. For every 9 tasks we took a screenshot prooving, we succesfully completed all of them.
in order to move our screenshots to the sandbox folder I followed the following steps:
1- move screenshots to where I will launch sftp (user folder for my case)
2- copies the sftp from the sandbox 
3- type password
4- navigate to the folder where I will put them
5- run put file
6- save everything to GitHub
7- run exit
